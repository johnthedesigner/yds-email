                              <p>
                                It was so wonderful to see so many of you at our
                                meeting on March 5. The day was filled with lots
                                of fun, laughter and learning about the
                                difference between bulbs and tubers. Plus we got
                                a ton of chicken wire balls created! Thanks to
                                all our members who turned out for the Bloom
                                Exhibit planning meeting and pitched in. We
                                loved connecting with all of you who were there.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                The days are noticeably lighter for longer, and
                                itâ€™s exciting to start planning for our new
                                season of planting. As we look back over the
                                past two years, we would like to thank those of
                                our YDS Growing Partners who helped make it
                                possible for YDS to bring all of you two
                                fantastic tuber sales and to forge partnership
                                and friendship connections that went beyond
                                simply the dahlias. We are truly grateful to our
                                past Growing Partners and we look forward to
                                reconnecting with our continuing Growing
                                Partners for 2023.

                                Here in the Northern Hemisphere we have yet to

                                Hemisphere itâ€™s dahlia show season and dahlias
                                are still blooming. What could be better at this
                                time of year than to see a dahlia garden full of
                                dahlias in bloom and watch the creation of a

                                The amaryllis are blooming. More will come out
                                of the basement every couple of weeks, with the
                                goal of continuous blooms until springtime, when
                                the daffodils and allium will rise to kick off
                                another season. But, in between the amaryllis
                                and the daffodils, the stars of the show are
                                always the dahlias.

                                Tracing back, it probably began in the fall of
                                2016 (a guess) when my partner and I
                                serendipitously wandered into the Provincetown
                                Dahlia show. The amazing colors, variety of
                                shapes and sizes and vibrancy of these
                                delightful wonders of nature started me on a
                                path I know is shared by many.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                I also know I am in good company with the
                                process of dahlias taking their hold. It began
                                with a few packages, most likely purchased from
                                a chain store, and not much care or effort was
                                given to the method of digging and
                                overwintering. Year by year, various perennials
                                were relocated, lettuce was evicted from the
                                small raised bed, and tomatoes graciously
                                stepped aside, all to make room for more
                                dahlias.

                                Compared to many, my garden is small- a 10 x 10
                                foot postage stamp outside our back porch, three
                                small raised beds on the side of the house,
                                trying to capture every inch of full-sun light,
                                various containers in the driveway, and starting
                                in summer of 2022, a 15 x 15 plot of dirt at the
                                community garden. I am already on a wait list
                                for a larger size plot. And also, I am
                                attempting to embrace the challenge of limited
                                space, to be intentional and selective, and to
                                feel grateful for what I am able to grow.

                                Last year I planted 24 tubers at home (lost
                                several to rot). At the community garden there
                                were 6 varieties and approximately 15 plants. I
                                love ball dahlias; the colors are gorgeous and
                                since I have limited space I am interested in
                                reliable and productive varieties. I love the
                                types that have some variation in color-for
                                example: Caitlinâ€™s Joy: purple with salmon and
                                coral undertones, Suncrest: golden yellow with
                                some orange undertone and Bracken Rose: a dusty
                                rose color that changes during the season. I
                                also have a fondness for the varieties that age
                                well in a vase.

                                I have always loved gardening, something I have
                                inherited from both of my parents and that
                                connection becomes more meaningful now that both
                                my parents have passed away. I love being able
                                to walk into the garden and cut flowers to have
                                in our own home and to also give to friends and
                                family. In addition to dahlias, I also love
                                snapdragons (Madame Butterfly) zinnias (Queen
                                Lime Series, Benaryâ€™s Giant), marigolds,
                                scabiosa among others. I love to watch the
                                delight when other people see the garden or
                                receive flowers. Sharing the joy with others is
                                part of what is meaningful to me about
                                gardening. I also enjoy the camaraderie with
                                other gardeners and people from YDS-the spirit
                                of everyone nurturing and supporting this
                                collective passion.

                                For this coming season I am focusing on adding
                                more plants for foliage to make bouquets more
                                interesting. I am also sharing my interest in
                                dahlias with other gardener friends and
                                encouraging them to try dahlias. One thing that
                                I recommend to anyone who is new to growing
                                dahlias is to buy locally, preferably from a
                                dahlia society. That way you know you are
                                getting something that grows well in this
                                climate, and at the same time you are supporting
                                a local organization that is focused on making
                                dahlia growing accessible to more people.

                                You may have heard it recommended to add Epsom
                                salt to the planting hole when youâ€™re planting
                                your dahlias, for a whole range of benefits from
                                greener foliage to more and bigger blooms. But
                                before you rush out to the grocery store for a
                                $5 bag or two, itâ€™s important to get an
                                understanding of whether or not you really need
                                it.

                                with YDS member Lori Nelson about dahlias, of
                                course, and the subject of Epsom salt came up.
                                Lori shared with us a podcast about it she had
                                found very interesting, and we want to share it

                                Epsom salt is a naturally occurring compound
                                consisting of magnesium and sulfur (MgSO4). It
                                is named for a spring in Epsom, England where it
                                was discovered. Epsom salt will certainly add
                                magnesium and sulfur to your soil, both of which
                                plants definitely need. The question is, does
                                your soil have enough magnesium and sulfur
                                already? If so, do you really have to add any
                                more? The best way to answer this question is to
                                start with a soil test.

                                Spring is a great time to get a soil sample in
                                preparation to plant. It is easy to collect
                                samples and send in for results. Weâ€™ve had soil
                                tests done at the University of Massachusetts
                                and the University of Maine. The results of the
                                tests were similar, and showed that the soil
                                tested had more magnesium than necessary, along
                                with adequate levels of sulfur. It turned out we
                                didnâ€™t need to add any magnesium or sulfur to
                                the garden soil we tested.

                                As things are a bit slower this time of year, do
                                you have some extra time to help out the club?
                                Come and join us as there is something we are
                                always working on. Spring is around the corner
                                and we need to get the remaining tubers labeled
                                and start organizing and making plans for our
                                2023 YDS Growing Partners and the tubers we will
                                grow out for club stock.
